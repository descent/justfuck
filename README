A JUST-in-time brainFUCK compiler.

This is a fun project I wrote back in 2009.
* It analysis the Brainfuck code and optimizes consecutive operators.
* It generates x86 target code and executes it immediately.

Note:
* This was written back in 2009 and I didn't look back to improve it. 
* I'm more skilled in Linux / C++ / git now.
